title: "Teaching"

---
I teach biostatistics courses across all education levels, including undergraduate, masters, and PhD student learners. I also develop courses for traditional in-person experiences as well as classes that are delivered completely online. I design my courses to ease students back into a mathematical mindset, and slowly build up to statistical formulae through intuitive and instructive real-world examples. 

In recognition of my teaching achievements, while maintaining an active research portfolio, I was selected as the **2015 Northeastern University Kenerson Faculty Scholar**, an award that recognizes a faculty member who has shown a commitment to improving the health of people in the urban community through interdisciplinary research and teaching activities.
