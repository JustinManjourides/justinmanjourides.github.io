I am an Associate Professor of Biostatistics in the [Health Sciences](http://www.northeastern.edu/bouve/health-sciences/) department at [Northeastern University](www.northeastern.edu) helping to cultivate the next generation of real-world evidence (RWE) and population health researchers. My leadership in RWE includes being co-PI for the [Real-World Health Navigator](https://impactengines.northeastern.edu/ie/rwhn/) Impact Engine, directing the [MS in RWE](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/programs/real-world-evidence-in-healthcare-and-life-sciences-ms/) program, and advising several [Population Health](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/programs/population-health-phd/) PhD students. I also co-lead the Data Modeling and Analytics Cores for the [PROTECT](https://protect.sites.northeastern.edu/) and [ECHO](https://echochildren.org/) Centers at Northeastern, two centers dedicated to studying the links between exposures to environmental contamination and adverse birth and child development outcomes

My methodological research into novel statistical techniques has generally revolved around improving how missing or mis-measured data can be appropriately considered in complex statistical analyses. Through all my work I thoughtfully blend classical statistical models with modern computational methods, such as machine learning and AI, to analyze large and complex datasets efficiently, but more important: appropriately.

I earned a BS in Mathematics and Statistics from the [University of Florida](www.ufl.edu) in 2004 and my PhD in Biostatistics from [Harvard Unviersity](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics) in 2009.
