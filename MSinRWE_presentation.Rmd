## Clinical Decision Making

- How do we (doctor?) decide what treatment to give to a patient? 
- How do we know if those treatments are safe? 



## Real-World Data

- Real-World Data are the data relating to patient health status and/or the delivery of health care routinely collected from a variety of sources.

- Sources
  - Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
  - Claims and billing data
  - Patient-generated data (including wearables)
  - Product and Patient registries

## Real-World Evidence
- RWE is the clinical evidence regarding the usage and potential benefits, or risks of a medical product derived from analysis of real-world data (RWD).

- RWE can be generated by different study designs or analyses, including but not limited to, randomized trials, including large simple trials, pragmatic trials, and observational studies (prospective and/or retrospective).
